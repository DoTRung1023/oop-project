In Animal Chess, players control a team of eight animals, playing to occupy the
opponent's fortress. Victory is achieved either by successfully taking over the opponent's
fortress or by eliminating all enemy animals. Each player has 3 types of animals and 2
animals each type including Mice, elephant and dog.

Each animal that a player controls holds a unique attack rule:
+ Only Mice can attack and eliminate Elephant
+ Only Elephant can attack and eliminate Dog
+ Only Dog can attack and eliminate Mice
+ 2 animals of the same type cannot attack each other.

Each turn, a player needs to move 1 animal in his team, the animal can only move 1
square forward, backward, to the left or to the right. It is illegal to move diagonally.

Animals can only attack enemy’s animals which are in the square that is next to it, after
an offensive movement, that animal cannot continue moving.

Each side has 3 soldiers who are protecting their fortress. When an animal
attacks the fortress, both the fortress and the animal are eliminated. This is also the only
way to kill the opponent’s soldiers. In this game, soldiers cannot move, their only
mission is protecting the fortress.
